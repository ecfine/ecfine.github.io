I am a seagoing observational oceanographer. The ocean plays a central role in regulating global climate: 90% of the additional thermal energy due to global warming is stored in the ocean. My goal is to identify and quantify the processes that control heat storage and transport in the global ocean. I collect and analyze observations from seagoing research cruises, moorings, and autonomous profilers and use models to contextualize these observations.
